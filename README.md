The Logistic map is commonly used map in chaos-based image encryption

             
             Functions:
              Main function         : main.m
              Logistic_map fuction  : logistic.m
              
              
              
              
             Logistic map is mathematically expressed as x_n+1 = γ*x_n(1 − x_n) 
             
             Input the value to x and y;
             
                 x=  ; % Initial values
                 y=  ; % Parameter value
